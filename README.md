# aws-lab

## Overview

## General guidelines

## Region

In this lab, we will only use the ireland region:

**eu-west-1**

## Ressources parameters

For all non specified parameters when creating ressources with console / cli / sdk, please leave default ones.

## When AFK for a long time

Always think about stopping your ressources if you don't use them for a long time (lunch break for example).

If you have finished the lab and won't use the ressources anymore, think about all cleaning/deleting.

Very important for not paying what you do not use !

### Ressource tagging

Tags is a mandatory feature in cloud computing, especially using AWS.
It is used for :
* Recognizing ressources
* Finops 

In this lab, the mandatory tagging policy is :
* **Name** : the name of the ressource
* **Owner** : the name of the owner
* **Project** : the name of the project

Always try to give a comprehensive name for ressources, so you can easily find them when needed.

## How to

## At the end

Please think about deleting all your ressources when done.
This is important to not exceed the allocated budget.

Go reverse on the module, and delete one by one all ressources created before leaving.
